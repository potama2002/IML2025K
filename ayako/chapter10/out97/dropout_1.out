The Rinzai sect (@@ Rin@@ zai@@ z@@ ai) is one of the five sects of Zen in China (@@ Rin@@ z@@ ai, the Zen sect of Zen Buddhism), and the founder of the sect of Zen Buddhism (@@ 67@@ 8 - 67@@ 8) was the founder of the Rinzai sect.
He was known as "@@ Rin@@ zai@@ ," and "@@ Rin@@ zai@@ zai@@ zai@@ zai@@ ," and he became the peak of the prosperity of Chinese Zen Buddhism as a characteristic of a wealthy family.
It is a kan@@ zen@@ zen (@@ Zen medit@@ ation) that aimed at becoming a Zen priest, and there is a difference between Moku@@ sho of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism and Moku@@ sho of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism.
Rinzai Sect in China
As the name suggest@@ s, the Rinzai Sect was founded by G@@ ig@@ en, the founder of the sect of Buddhism in the end of the Tang Dynasty.
Rin@@ sai was a disciple of M@@ you@@ n and his base was based in the Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Province, and the Yuan Dynasty expanded its power as a suppor@@ ter of J@@ oj@@ un of the X@@ ian@@ z@@ h@@ w@@ ang Dynasty of the emerg@@ ence of the emerg@@ ence of the Yuan Dynasty, but the Northern Dynasty was dis@@ rup@@ ted by the confusion of the five dynast@@ ies during the period of the late Tang Dynasty.
The central figure in this period was En@@ sho FU@@ NA@@ HA@@ RA.
In the Northern Sung period, the Rinzai Sect was re@@ pu@@ ted to be a disciple of Ch@@ u SHIMO@@ TSU@@ KE@@ I in the Northern Song period, and two monks of the Rinzai sect such as Ry@@ ut@@ eki E@@ N@@ G and Y@@ og@@ etsu of the Y@@ og@@ ata school of the Y@@ og@@ ata school of the Rinzai Sect were born in the second volume of China.
In the Southern Sung period, Dai@@ e So@@ ei, who was a disciple of Kai@@ k@@ ei, who belonged to the Y@@ og@@ i school, formed the Dai@@ e school as a bas@@ e, and became the main school of the Rinzai sect.
Rinzai Sect in Japan
According to the school, it is said that the school was brought to Japan from India by Ju@@ hachi@@ dai@@ , who succeeded to the teachings of Got@@ ama and S@@ idd@@ har@@ th@@ a (@@ enlighten@@ ment@@ ), and was brought to Japan by D@@ harm@@ a, the 2@@ 8th D@@ harm@@ a, from Indi@@ a.
After that, the Rinzai sect, which was the highest peak of the Zen sect, was brought to Japan during the Kamakura period by E@@ isai and others who learned from the Southern Song Dynasty.
The Rinzai Sect in Japan is one of the sects of Zen in Japan.
He valued the trans@@ mission of the trans@@ mission of the trans@@ mission of the teachings to his master from his master to his discip@@ le, and his discipl@@ es.
The principal statue of Shaka Nyorai is Shaka Nyorai Dai@@ sho (@@ high-ranking Buddhist priest of the highest ord@@ er) Shaka Nyorai (@@ Shakyam@@ un@@ i) and the first head priest named D@@ harm@@ a, D@@ harm@@ a, and the founder of the sect, Rin@@ s@@ ai, the founder of the sect, is called the founder of the sect.
While the Soto sect of the same Zen sect spread among local ruling families and common people, the Rinzai Sect was supported by the military government of the time and was highly valued as a political and culture.
After that, the Rinzai Sect was rebuilt by the Zen master Haku@@ in Zen@@ ji in the Edo period, and it is also said that the current Zen Zen Sect was rebuilt in the Edo period, and the current Zen Sect is said to have been Haku@@ in zen@@ z@@ en.
Traditional tradition
The trans@@ mission of enlightenment from a master named H@@ otsu@@ gu, to a disciple of a master named H@@ otsu@@ gu, continued to exist today.
His master and his disciples were called secret secret in the room, and they were not open to the public.
His master and his disciples were called Z@@ ens@@ ei@@ roku (a record of Zen Buddhism), which had been written by his master and his pupil@@ , and various works were written by his master, but in the Song period, he rejected the idea that it was not based on the understanding of modern literature but in the words that he had written in various way@@ s.
However, it is a record that people would lead enlightenment to enlightenment and it is very well known from the time when Zen was found@@ , and it has been a large number of books from the time of its establish@@ ment.
As a result, the Zen sect had changed the style of lect@@ uring of Zen med@@ itation to the introduction of Zen med@@ itation called kan@@ n@@ a-@@ zen@@ z@@ u, and the authority of the master of the Tang Dynasty, who was the founder of the Tang Dynasty, was not seen in the style of a lect@@ ures.
When his master resigned from his body and left the body of the school, he chose to sel@@ ect the successor at least at least and had no choice but to attain enlighten@@ ment, and his master and his disciples are well known.
The reason why the new master could not attain enlightenment if he was a master of the time of his ment@@ or who had attained enlightenment without becoming enlighten@@ ed, was to be able to become a disciple of a disciple of a master who could attain enlighten@@ ment.
The master is not only one person but also a master, and if there are several mast@@ ers, the master does not have the trac@@ es of the master and the master does not have the trac@@ es of the master to take over the position of his mast@@ er.
It is divided into several bran@@ ch@@ es, and some of its flow disappeared and some of them have been passed down from the seventh century to the present day.
En@@ lighten@@ ment
Gener@@ ally speaking, the Zen sect emphas@@ izes the enlighten@@ ment.
The meaning of enlightenment in the Zen sect means that all living things are the true nature of Buddha@@ -@@ nat@@ ure.
For this reason, the master of the Tang Dynasty, KO no Mor@@ of@@ u@@ ji, who was the founder of the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), had a hard fight and was so hard that he had to go back to the world.
However, after the Song period, many techniques were invented to attain enlightenment through the period of the Song Dynasty.
Z@@ az@@ en (@@ different from that of medit@@ ation) and ko@@ an (@@ understanding the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the enlighten@@ ment@@ ), which had already been achieved by the Zen priest who had already attained enlightenment such as reading of the sutr@@ a, reading the sutr@@ a, reading of the sutr@@ a, and reading of the sutr@@ a, and the way to attain enlighten@@ ment.
It is said that the fire of R@@ os@@ co@@ w was brought to by R@@ os@@ co@@ w and his disciples to become his discip@@ le.
This is not the trans@@ mission of the word (@@ ro@@ ot@@ ).
Therefore, it is said that he chose the correct Zen master Zen@@ ji.
It also means not to attain enlighten@@ ment, but to sel@@ ect Zen@@ ji who were suitable for his individu@@ ality.
However, it does not mean that the Zen master who had attained enlightenment should be able to attain enlighten@@ ment.
The master of the period of the Tang Dynasty was not able to hold Go@@ od@@ ama (@@ Buddha statue of Buddha@@ ), who had attained enlightenment without having any ment@@ or to become a priest, and the master of the Tang Dynasty did not attain enlighten@@ ment.
Although it is not defined by the words of enlighten@@ ment, it is possible to represent the state of enlightenment by various ways such as words and word@@ s.
As a result, after the introduction of Japan to Japan, it is expressed in expressions such as poetry and paint@@ ing, and it can be said that the fragr@@ ance can be tast@@ ed.
In addition to the art of art, it is expressed as a ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ y, such as Sado (tea ceremony) and k@@ ado (@@ flower arrang@@ ement@@ ), and it is also a way to enjoy the world of enlighten@@ ment.
It is not a kind of understand@@ ing.
Public draft system
It was compiled after the Song period, and it was possible to make a lot of enlighten@@ ment.
The ko@@ an is mainly a story of a story between a master and his disciple and a disciple of his disciple and a disciple of his disciple and a disciple of his pupil@@ s, and there are many stories about the fact that his disciples would be able to attain enlighten@@ ment.
Also, ko@@ an is a story that does not accept log@@ ic and understand@@ ing, and it can only be understood only by the fact that it is an idea that it is not to understand the log@@ ic, but also by the idea that it is a plan to make a ko@@ an.
It was a ko@@ an system, which was a system to comp@@ ly with these ko@@ an, and was composed by 500 to 19@@ 00.
The system of ko@@ an was different from that of shi@@ tsu@@ .
An example of a plan given in the early stage
I have to be able to be a Buddha, but it is not a Buddha@@ -@@ nat@@ ure@@ .'
For this reason, in Buddhism, there is a knowledge that '@@ all living things have the Buddhist nat@@ ure@@ .'
The sound of the te@@ eth of the te@@ eth of the hand is the sound of the fing@@ er@@ .'
His disciples had to write the sound of the sound of the fing@@ er to the mast@@ er.
In a sense of wis@@ dom@@ , the fing@@ er does not have any pit@@ ch to be able to be able to be able to make a sound@@ .

Fushimi-jo Castle was a castle located in present Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City.
The '@@ Fushimi Mom@@ oy@@ ama-jo Cast@@ le' is not a modern architectural style (@@ details are described in the main tex@@ t).
The Fushimi-jo Castle was originally constructed by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI as a residence after his retire@@ ment.
The castle was built for three times and the castle was originally built on Mt. Tsuk@@ iy@@ ama, and the castle was moved to Tsuk@@ iyama Castle after the earth@@ ly earth@@ qu@@ ake, and it is distinguished from the castle of Kit@@ ah@@ ata Castle after the earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es.
In addition, the Toyotomi period, which was founded at the time of its found@@ ation, is divided into two categ@@ ori@@ es: the Toyotomi period when the Toyotomi clan was found@@ ed, and the Tokugawa clan was rebuilt after the Battle of Sekiga@@ hara.
After the death of Hideyoshi, Hideyori TOYOTOMI moved to the Osaka-jo Castle, and Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, the head of the Got@@ air@@ o (@@ Council of Five Eld@@ ers), entered this castle and took control of the government.
During the Battle of Sekigahara, Motot@@ ada TORI@@ I, who was a vassal of Ieyasu, was captured and burnt down by the Ishi@@ da side (the Battle of Fushimi-jo Castle).
Later, the castle was rebuilt by Ieyasu and the castle was relocated to various places after the abolition of the castle.
After the aband@@ onment of the castle was abolished, the area of the castle was called Mom@@ oyama-@@ h@@ ata (@@ place where the castle was loc@@ at@@ ed).
This is because Fushimi-jo Castle is commonly called "@@ Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Cast@@ le@@ " (@@ Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI@@ 's period of the Oda and Toyotomi government@@ s), and the name "@@ Mom@@ oyama-@@ cult@@ ure@@ " (@@ Momoyama Period@@ ) is derived from this name.
According to a record that the descendants of the Yoshimura family, which had been re@@ claimed to be the Yoshimura family, served as sh@@ oya (@@ village head@@ man) of the H@@ ori@@ uchi-@@ mura village, which was built on the site of Fushimi-jo Castle in the Meiji period, and donated the land to the Imperial Family in the Meiji period.
It is not directly related to historical fact@@ s.
Because the castle tower of the Tokugawa clan was relocated to the Nijo-jo Castle, there is a relatively relatively few historical materials that have been kept in the castle but the number of the castle tow@@ ers before the time is unknown.
Det@@ ails are unknown.
159@@ 2: The castle was relocated to a part of the remains of the J@@ urak@@ udai building which was located along the Uji-gawa River as a place where Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI retire@@ d.
In 159@@ 6 (@@ 159@@ 6 - 159@@ 6) the castle was demol@@ ished due to earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es, and it was newly constructed by Koh@@ at@@ ayama (@@ today's Mom@@ oyama-@@ yama Castle).
159@@ 8: Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died in this castle.
16@@ 00@@ : The temple was burnt down in the Battle of Fushimi-jo Castle.
160@@ 1: The temple was rebuilt by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.
160@@ 3: It was used as a ceremony to appoint the Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians@@ ").
After the Siege of Osaka, the role of Fushimi-jo Castle was transferred to Osaka-jo Castle and the importance of this castle was weak@@ ened because the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) had no important importance on this castle and the castle was aband@@ on@@ ed.
196@@ 4: Fushimi Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Castle was built on the site of Han@@ ab@@ atake in Fushimi-jo Castle, and the '@@ Fushimi Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Cast@@ le' (@@ Fushimi Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Cast@@ le), which was modeled on the '@@ Fushimi Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Cast@@ le' (@@ Fushimi Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Castle) was construc@@ ted.
January 200@@ 3: The city of Fushimi Mom@@ oyama-@@ jo Castle was closed as a part of a c@@ ath@@ ed@@ ral of Kintetsu Corpor@@ ation, which was the parent body of the manag@@ ement.
Fushimi Mom@@ oy@@ ama-jo Castle was preserved as a symbol of Fushimi as a symbol of Fushimi by the movement of the citizens of Kyoto City and escaped from being demol@@ ished.
The park is currently constructed as a par@@ k.
Although Kyoto City was allowed to take over the property without any compens@@ ation, it is not open to the public.
October 200@@ 7: Due to the fil@@ ming of '@@ ch@@ as@@ ai no Kis@@ ai no Kis@@ ai no Kis@@ ai no him@@ o' (@@ Princess of Ch@@ at@@ a), a period of period dram@@ as, it was changed to Osaka-jo Castle with a decorative decorative ornam@@ ent and a decorative ornam@@ ent attached to a tur@@ ret@@ .
The cost of the reconstruction cost of 1 bill@@ ion yen was carried out by Toei and the reconstruction of the Osaka-jo Castle was continued for a year.
When the castle was aband@@ on@@ ed, many ten@@ shu such as ten@@ shu were relocated to another place when the castle was aband@@ on@@ ed.
There are famous buildings such as Nijo-jo Castle and J@@ oj@@ ak@@ ko-ji Temple (@@ Bingo Province), and Fuku@@ yama-jo Castle (@@ Bingo Province), many facilities such as a tur@@ ret@@ , a tur@@ ret@@ , a castle gate and a building are moved to Fuku@@ yama-jo Castle.
The main facilities that have been relocated to its current location are as follows.
In addition, it was decided that the only one of the remains of the Sai@@ kyo@@ -ji Temple and Fuku@@ yama-jo Castle Fushimi yagura (@@ castle tow@@ er) which were the remains of Mt. S@@ uki was the only one of the remains of the Fuku@@ yama Mountain R@@ ang@@ e.

The Kano school was one of the largest painting schools in Japan from the middle of the Muromachi period to the end of the Edo period (the ninet@@ eenth centur@@ y), and was a group of painters who were active in the center of painting and was active for about 400 years from the middle to the end of the Edo period.
After the collapse of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Masanobu KA@@ NO, who was the official painter of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), served Nobunaga ODA, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Tokugawa Shogun in the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and his descendants played a central role in the center of painting at the center of the wall wall paintings such as Dai@@ ri@@ , Dai@@ ri@@ , Dai@@ ri@@ , Dai@@ ri@@ , and so on.
The Kano school was a group of painters who had a blood relationship with blood relatives such as his parents and brothers and they had a long life of about four to four centur@@ ies, and it was almost impossible to find any example in the world.
The representative painters of the Kano school are Masanobu KANO and Moton@@ obu KANO who served the 8th shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), E@@ itoku KA@@ NO, E@@ itoku who was a grandson of Moton@@ obu and a grandson of Moton@@ obu KA@@ NO, and E@@ itoku from Azuchi-jo Castle and the wall paintings of Osaka-jo Castle and Osaka-jo Castle were moved from Kyoto to Edo from Kyoto to Edo, and he was known as one of the representative painters of the Kano school in Kyoto.
After the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was stabil@@ ized, the Kano school was forced to supply a large amount of wall paintings such as dairi (Imperial Palace) and castle wall@@ s.
The head of the Kano family was allowed to produce a group of painters and painter painters of the family.
As a result, painters of the Kano school were required to learn how to learn the method of painting by painting powder (@@ picture book@@ s) which had been handed down to their ancestor@@ s' ancestor@@ s.
From the background of this period, the Kano school after Tan@@ yu KANO continued to maintain the traditional and the influence of the power of the Kano school as a go@@ yo-@@ eshi (a painter of the art of art@@ is@@ ans@@ ).
In the modern age of apprec@@ iation of the paintings of the Kano school is not necessarily considered to be highly valu@@ able for the paintings of the Kano school.
However, it is a fact that the Kano school had established the Japanese painting circles for about four centur@@ ies in the fourth century, and that many painters grew up, and it cannot be said that the Kano school could not understand the history of Japanese paint@@ ing.
Many Japanese painters from the early modern period were influenced by the Kano school, and Kor@@ in OGA@@ TA and Ok@@ yo MARU@@ YAMA of the Rin@@ p@@ a school also studied under the Kano school.
The founder of the Kano school was Masanobu KANO (@@ 143@@ 4 - 15@@ 30@@ ) who was active as a painter of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
He was active from the middle of the fifteenth century to the first half of the 16th century.
The origin of Masanobu is said to have been in the Izu region, but it is not certain@@ .
Based on the progress in the latter half of the twent@@ i@@ eth century, the Kano family is thought to have had a connection with the Nagao clan in Shimotsuke Province (@@ Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture), and it is considered that the original works of Kan@@ sui-@@ ga in Ch@@ or@@ in-ji Temple in Ashikaga City was a relatively early work of Masanobu in the early period.
The first case in which Masanobu as a painter in the painting industry was recorded as a painter in Kyoto at the time of the Onin War (@@ 146@@ 7 - 147@@ 7) and the mur@@ als of the mur@@ als were painted at Un@@ ch@@ in-@@ in Temple (@@ Shokoku-ji Temple, sub-@@ temple of Shokoku-ji Temple) in Kyoto at the age of 30 in 146@@ 3 and at the age of 30, it is known that the painting of the mur@@ als of the Rak@@ ans were already active at the time of the Kyoto pain@@ ter.
The main temple of Shokoku-ji Temple, which was founded by the third Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and was the main temple of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), which was the main temple of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) founded by the third Shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and at that time it was a painter of painting by Z@@ h@@ u Z@@ h@@ u S@@ HA@@ N@@ G (@@ 14 to 148@@ 1).
It is clear that Masanobu KANO went up to Kyoto and studied under the official painter of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), but it is not clear whether he became an official painter of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and that it was given important posts by Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, the 8th shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
In 148@@ 7, a few years after the Onin War (@@ 146@@ 7 - 14@@ 77@@ ), Sot@@ an, who was a painter of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), died in 148@@ 1, and it is thought that Masanobu KANO was appointed to the official painter of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) after Sot@@ an succeeded to the site of Sot@@ an.
After that, Mitsu@@ nobu TO@@ SA of the Yamato-@@ e group of Yamato-@@ e painting and Masanobu KANO of the Kano school of Chinese paint@@ ing, who had served as E@@ ta no azuk@@ ari (a person in charge of managing the painting of the pict@@ ure) of the Imperial Court.
In 148@@ 2, the former Shogun, Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, started construction of Higashiyam@@ ad@@ ono (the predecessor of G@@ ink@@ aku-ji Temple), and Masanobu was in charge of wall part@@ s.
After the death of Yoshimasa in 149@@ 0, Masanobu began to serve the Hosokawa clan who held real power in those days.
As a result, Masanobu deep@@ ened his position in the art circles and established the foundation for the prosperity of the Kano school.
According to the record@@ , Masanobu had various forms and subjects such as wall paintings and Buddhist paint@@ ing, but all of the wall paintings were lost and the wall paintings were painted in a small screen such as kake@@ jiku (@@ hanging scroll@@ ).
In contrast with the traditional Japanese painting style of Mitsu@@ nobu TO@@ SA of the same period, his painting style was '@@ Chinese paint@@ ing@@ ' based on the Chinese painting style of the Sung and Yuan Dynast@@ ies.
Although Masanobu had lived at the age of 9@@ 7 and lived for about 30 years, his achievements in his later years were not clear.
The second generation Moton@@ obu KANO (@@ 147@@ 6 - 155@@ 9) was the legitimate son of Masanobu and was born in 147@@ 6.
His representative works are the wall painting at the hojo of Dai@@ sen@@ -in Temple in Daitoku-ji Temple (@@ completed in 15@@ 13@@ ), and the wall painting at Myoshin-ji Temple in Myoshin-ji Temple in 154@@ 3, and the wall painting at Myoshin-ji Temple Rei@@ un@@ -in in Myoshin-ji Temple in 154@@ 3, which is considered to have been a little later than the time when the wall was completed.
The wall paintings of the hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's chamb@@ er) of Dai@@ sen@@ -in Temple were produced by So@@ ami and his younger brother Moton@@ obu and his younger brother Yukin@@ obu KA@@ NO, and Moton@@ obu was in charge of the "@@ Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds and Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds and Bir@@ d@@ s) and the "@@ Zen Z@@ hi@@ tsu@@ sho Z@@ u" (a collection of Zen priest@@ s), which was written by Moton@@ obu in the '@@ Z@@ oh@@ achi no Z@@ u' (a room for the tea ceremony of the head priest@@ ).
Among them, "@@ Zen S@@ oshi Z@@ u" is a typical ink@@ -@@ wash painting, but "@@ Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds of Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, and "@@ Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s, Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds of Four Se@@ as@@ on@@ s," shows a new sen@@ sit@@ ive sen@@ se.
Moton@@ obu had a connection with the Ashikaga Shogun and the Hosokawa family, who were powerful in those days, and had many disciples and established the foundation of the Kano school as a group of pain@@ ters.
It is also known that in order not only samurai but also court nobles, temples and shrines but also temples but also temples and shrines, Moton@@ obu painted wall paintings of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple, which was located in Osaka, and it is known that this does not exist any more.
In his later years, Moton@@ obu called himself '@@ Echizen no kami (Governor of Echizen Province@@ )' and was granted the rank of a priest called '@@ Hog@@ en@@ ,' and later he was called 'K@@ ob@@ og@@ en' or '@@ Echizen Hog@@ an' and so on.
The re@@ per@@ to@@ ire in his works is wid@@ ened wid@@ ely, and there are scrolls of Eng@@ i-@@ em@@ aki (@@ picture scroll@@ ) of temples and shrines, E@@ ma Em@@ aki (@@ picture scroll@@ ), E@@ ma (@@ folding scre@@ en), Yamato-@@ e (@@ painting of Yamato-@@ e paint@@ ing@@ )) and so on.
Moton@@ obu was good at painting Chinese paintings and paintings of Yamato-@@ e painting (@@ painting of Yamato-@@ e painting of Yamato-@@ e painting in Japan), which he was good at his father Masanobu and he was good at painting and folding scre@@ ens, and established the foundation of the Kano school of the Kano school.
It is also said that he established a painting style called '@@ shin@@ tai@@ ' (@@ shin@@ tai@@ ) in his painting style and '@@ shos@@ ei' (@@ cur@@ sive style of writing Chinese character@@ s), and it is also said that he was the founder of the wall wall paintings in the early modern period.
Moton@@ obu had three son@@ s; Mun@@ enobu and Hideyori and his eldest son Mun@@ enobu died young, but his third son Mun@@ enobu inherited the head family from his third son Na@@ oy@@ oshi, 15@@ 19 to 159@@ 2.
It is not clear whether the second son of Hidey@@ ori, who was not the second son of Hidey@@ ori, and his third son Na@@ on@@ obu would succeed to the family est@@ ate.
Na@@ on@@ obu was widely known by the name of Sho@@ ei KANO and was active from the Muromachi period to the Momoyama period.
His representative works include "@@ Ne@@ han-@@ zu (P@@ ain@@ ting of N@@ irv@@ an@@ a@@ )," which is located in Daitoku-ji Temple.
Along with his father, Moton@@ obu also participated in the wall paintings of the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple, and he participated with his son E@@ itoku in the wall painting of Juk@@ o-in Temple in Daitoku-ji Temple, but since his father Moton@@ obu and his son E@@ it@@ oku, both of them were highly well-@@ known.
E@@ itoku KANO (@@ 154@@ 3 - 159@@ 0) who was the legitimate son of Sho@@ ei MATSU@@ MATSU was also called J@@ oshu and was one of the representative Japanese paintings in the Momoyama period.
In response to the intention of the war such as Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, many wall paintings were painted on the wall of the wall with the structure and the existing works of E@@ itoku were completely dis@@ mant@@ led with the structure of the building.
The wall paintings at the hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's quar@@ ters) of the Hojo family in the Hon@@ k@@ o-in Temple of Daitoku-ji Temple, one of the representative master@@ pieces of the existing works were E@@ itoku and his father, Sho@@ ei, but his father, Sho@@ ei MATSU@@ MATSU, made a sliding screen screen painting at the southern corner of the hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's chamb@@ er) to E@@ itoku and his son E@@ itoku in the fron@@ t.
In the feudal society at that time, the head of the main room of the house was always a person who drew fu@@ sum@@ a-@@ e (@@ sliding screen screen part@@ ition@@ ) of the main room, and it is said that Sho@@ ei transferred the head of the family to E@@ itoku who had a great talent for painting and was already retire@@ d.
Among the wall paintings at the hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's chamb@@ er) of Jok@@ o-in Temple, "@@ Hana no zu" (@@ room of flowers and bird@@ s) is highly evaluated and "@@ Hana no zu" (@@ room of flowers and bird@@ s) is decorated with Muro@@ ch@@ u, the central room of the Hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's chamb@@ er) is highly valu@@ ed.
After that, E@@ itoku was involved in the wall paintings of Azuchi-jo Castle which was built by Nobunaga ODA in 157@@ 6 to 157@@ 9.
After Nobunaga's death, he made wall paintings of Osaka-jo Castle and J@@ urak@@ udai (@@ castle guard@@ ) and was involved in the wall painting of the dairi (the Imperial Palace) in his later years.
These works were highly valued in di@@ aries and records of the time, and they were considered to have been a master@@ piece of E@@ it@@ oku, but they disappeared with the wall painting part@@ s.
In addition to the wall painting of the hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's chamb@@ er) of Juk@@ oin Temple mentioned above, it is said to have been written by E@@ itoku in Tokyo National Museum of Fine Art@@ s, and "@@ Raku@@ chu Rak@@ ug@@ ai zu Byo@@ bu Byo@@ bu@@ " (The folding screen of Raku@@ chu Rak@@ ug@@ ai in Kyoto) which was introduced by the Uesugi clan.
E@@ itoku was good at both Sai@@ ga and Tai@@ ga (@@ Tai@@ ga paint@@ ing), but it is said that he did not draw a large wall painting because he was good at making a large number of part@@ s.
Hos@@ o-@@ ga is considered to be a painting of a painting that was painted in a narrow part, and a large painting was regarded as a pict@@ orial pict@@ ure.
In the early modern period, there were many important painters other than the Kano school.
It is said that '@@ Hidey@@ ori@@ ,' a national treasure@@ , had a mark of '@@ Hidey@@ ori' since ancient times, and it has been said that '@@ Hidey@@ ori' was made by Hideyori KANO (@@ dates of birth and death unknown) who was the second son of Moton@@ obu KA@@ NO, but '@@ Hidey@@ ori' written by the author of "@@ Taka@@ o-@@ kan@@ p@@ ei-@@ zu" is different from that of '@@ Hidey@@ ori@@ ,' and it is said that he was a painter of the f@@ ic@@ tit@@ ious sen@@ se of Hideyori who was the grandson of Nobu@@ zan@@ e.
Mune@@ hide KANO (@@ 155@@ 1 - 160@@ 1) was a younger brother of E@@ itoku and worked as an assistant of E@@ itoku at Azuchi-jo Castle.
There are some existing works such as folding scre@@ ens and portr@@ ait@@ s.
In addition, Nagan@@ obu KANO (@@ 157@@ 7 - 165@@ 4), a younger brother of E@@ itoku and a younger brother of E@@ it@@ oku, is also famous as a master@@ piece of "@@ Hana Yug@@ aku-@@ zu@@ ."
Among the direct descendants of the Kano family, there are other painters such as Yoshi@@ zane KANO (@@ 155@@ 2 - 164@@ 0) who was the author of "@@ Ju@@ zu zu zu Byo@@ bu@@ " (@@ folding screen of art@@ is@@ ans@@ ), which was written by Ko@@ etsu KAWA@@ GO@@ E and Kita-@@ in, and Nai@@ zen KANO (@@ 167@@ 0 - 16@@ 16@@ 16@@ 16@@ ) who was a painter of "@@ Toy@@ okuni Matsuri Festival at Toy@@ okun@@ i-jinja Shrine in Kyoto, Kyoto City.
E@@ itoku KANO died at the age of 4@@ 8.
After that, the first son of E@@ itoku was Mitsu@@ nobu KANO (@@ 156@@ 5 - 160@@ 8) and the second son Yoshitaka KANO (@@ 157@@ 1 - 16@@ 18@@ ).
Mitsu@@ nobu left wall paintings of Kang@@ akuin K@@ yak@@ uden (@@ guest hall) of Onjo-ji Temple Kang@@ akuin Gaku@@ in Temple and so on, and his painting style was characterized by a del@@ icate style of Yamato-@@ e painting style.
This style of painting in the early modern period such as "@@ Honcho g@@ az@@ en" (@@ history of the Edo period written in the Muromachi period) has been highly evaluated as Mitsu@@ nobu as if this style of painting was not common at that time.
When Mitsu@@ nobu KA@@ NO, who was the head of the Kano family, died at the age of 12 (@@ 159@@ 7 - 16@@ 2@@ 3), his son Sadan@@ obu KANO was still young at the age of 12 and Nobutaka who was the younger brother of Mitsu@@ nobu led the Kano school.
Under the feudal system, the family line of Sadan@@ obu was supposed to become the head of the family, but since Sadan@@ obu died young at the age of 27, the lineage of Masat@@ aka KA@@ NO, the Kano family, was a descendant of Takan@@ obu from the Kano family to the end of the Edo period.
Takan@@ obu had three son@@ s: Morin@@ obu (@@ Tan@@ yu@@ ) (@@ 160@@ 2 - 16@@ 50@@ ), Na@@ on@@ obu KANO (@@ 160@@ 3-@@ 16@@ 50@@ ) and Na@@ on@@ obu KANO (@@ 16@@ 75@@ -@@ 16@@ 16@@ ) and these three were the founder of the Kob@@ ay@@ ashi-@@ Kano family and the Kob@@ ik@@ i-@@ bashi family (@@ head family of the Kano family).
His youngest brother, An@@ shin, was treated as an adopted child of Sadan@@ obu mentioned above, and he succeeded to the head family of the Kano school, but he was the most famous painter of the painting as a pain@@ ter.
Morin@@ obu later became a priest and called himself Tan@@ eki and was known as Tan@@ yu KA@@ NO, and was known as a painter of painting by Tan@@ yu KA@@ NO.
Later, he moved his home base to Edo and became an official painter of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and became an official painter of the Kano school in the art world.
Tan@@ yu had a great talent in painting since his child@@ hood, and in 16@@ 12, at the age of 11, he met Ieyasu TOKUGAWA at Sun@@ pu@@ -jo Castle at the age of 11, and in 16@@ 21, he moved his residence to the outside of the Az@@ ab@@ ashi-@@ mon gate of the Edo Az@@ ab@@ ashi-@@ mon Gate and worked hard to produce wall paintings such as a castle and a large wall wall wall wall wall with a large wall wall in Edo.
Among his works, the wall paintings of Edo-jo Castle and Osaka-jo Castle disappeared along with the walls of the wall painting at the castle hall (@@ Su@@ ib@@ oku@@ ), but during World War II, the wall paintings on the walls of the inside of the castle (@@ Sum@@ iz@@ u@@ ), which were removed from the building of the castle from the end of World War II, are still ext@@ ant and the wall paintings of the Got@@ o@@ e-jo Castle and the hojo (@@ ab@@ bot@@ 's chamb@@ er) of Daitoku-ji Temple are still existing today.
In addition to these large pict@@ ures, he left various works such as hanging scroll@@ s, picture scroll@@ s, folding scre@@ ens, folding scre@@ ens, and so on.
The wall painting at the Nin@@ omaru Got@@ en of the Nijo-jo Castle was painted at the age of twenty-@@ five and depicts the magnific@@ ent painting style of E@@ it@@ oku, but the wall painting of Daitoku-ji Temple in later years was a gent@@ le painting style with a thick ink ink ink painting and a gent@@ le painting style that had a gent@@ le style style with a gent@@ le and b@@ right col@@ or.
There are some picture scrolls and folding scre@@ ens, including Yamato-@@ e painting (a traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and Kamakura period@@ s).
Tan@@ yu focused on cop@@ ying and re@@ producing old paintings and re@@ production of old paintings and left many copies of cop@@ ying and cop@@ ying works.
There are many old paintings called '@@ Tan@@ yu Z@@ u' (@@ draw@@ ings of Tan@@ yu@@ ) that are known as '@@ Tan@@ yu Z@@ oku@@ zu' (@@ draw@@ ings of Tan@@ yu@@ ) and are owned by the museum@@ s and collect@@ ors in various places, but these are still in the possession of many old paintings which have lost the original draw@@ ings and have been valuable historical materials in the history of Japanese paint@@ ing.
The Kano school during the Edo period was a large group consisting of a group of blood groups consisting of the head family of the Kano family, and a large number of pupil@@ s across the country formed a p@@ hil@@ olog@@ ist@@ .
There were about 15@@ -@@ year-old '@@ Omot@@ e-@@ e E@@ ' which was the head of the four families of the highest social standing called Ok@@ u-@@ e E@@ shi (@@ painting of Ok@@ u-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ e-@@ E@@ ), and the position of 'K@@ ob@@ a-@@ e' which was not the official court and temples and shrines but was established in accordance with the dem@@ ands of the common townspeop@@ le and the '@@ machi@@ ' (@@ town and town@@ ) in order to deal with the dem@@ ands of townspeop@@ le.
In this period, the powerful persons in the feudal society des@@ ired to stabil@@ ize the stable of the feudal society, and the paintings depicted in public places such as Edo-jo Castle, were considered to be good for the traditional shir@@ ab@@ on.
In addition, there was a need to produce a large number of wall paintings and it was necessary to produce a group of pupil@@ s, and it was highly valued that it was more important to learn powder than those of painters rather than those of painters to make a group of pain@@ ters.
From this point of view, the painting of the Kano school became un@@ avo@@ id@@ able because there was little difference between the individual and the new tast@@ e.
As Ok@@ u-@@ e painter was a hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) with the same rank as hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and it can be said that he was allowed to wear a sword as a '@@ om@@ em@@ aki' (@@ om@@ e@@ ight@@ ) to be allowed to wear a sword.
The four families of Ok@@ u-@@ e painters were the black@@ sm@@ ith@@ , black@@ sm@@ ith@@ , which was a descendant of Tan@@ yu@@ yu (@@ Takan@@ obu KA@@ NO@@ ) who was the first son of Takan@@ obu (@@ Takan@@ obu KA@@ NO@@ ) and the Kaj@@ ik@@ awa-@@ cho family (the second son of Takan@@ obu KA@@ NO@@ ), and the Nak@@ ayama family line of Nobu@@ nobu KANO (the third son of Takan@@ obu KA@@ NO@@ ) was the second son of Nobu@@ nobu KA@@ NO, the second son of Nobut@@ ane KA@@ NO, the second son of Nobun@@ obu KA@@ NO.
Tan@@ yu did not have a biological child, and he adopted To@@ un (@@ Masu@@ nobu KA@@ NO@@ ) who was the son of the son of a swordsm@@ an named Tor@@ an@@ ori GOTO (@@ Nagam@@ asu KA@@ NO, 16@@ 25@@ -@@ 169@@ 4) who was a son of a sword craftsm@@ an named Ken@@ jo GO@@ TO@@ .
Later, Tan@@ yu took over the position of Mor@@ imasa KANO (@@ 165@@ 3 - 18@@ 18@@ ) who was the biological son of his father who was still fifty years old, but this was not the reason why he had to be the guardi@@ an.
Tan@@ yu had many pupil@@ s, but in the middle he left "@@ Yug@@ ao no n@@ aka no su@@ zu@@ e" (@@ picture of Yug@@ ao no yu@@ zu@@ ) and Kum@@ ori no kami (@@ dates of birth and death unknown) was well known.
Mor@@ ik@@ age ex@@ commun@@ icated the Kano school, and later produced in the Kanazawa area, but his career is unknown.
As mentioned above, the head family of the Kano family was succeeded by the Nak@@ ayama family, a younger brother of Tan@@ yu and a younger brother of Tan@@ yu@@ .
The son of Yasu@@ no@@ bu, Tok@@ in@@ obu KANO (@@ 164@@ 2 - 167@@ 8) died at the age of 30 and his son Ujin@@ obu KANO (@@ 167@@ 5 - 17@@ 24@@ ) took over the head of the family, but there was no pain@@ ter.
Ei@@ ichi HA@@ CHI@@ BA (@@ 165@@ 2 - 175@@ 4) was a disciple of An@@ shin@@ .
Among the four families of Ok@@ u-@@ e painters until the end of the Edo period, the Kob@@ ik@@ icho family which was a lineage of Na@@ on@@ obu was a member of the Tak@@ ah@@ ori family, which had a relatively high reputation until the end of the Edo period.
From this family, Tsun@@ enobu KANO (@@ 163@@ 6 - 17@@ 17@@ ) and his son Chik@@ an@@ obu KANO (@@ 166@@ 0 - 17@@ 28@@ ) and Min@@ enobu KANO (@@ 166@@ 2 - 166@@ 8).
Min@@ enobu was favored by the Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA and later became independent as the 'H@@ am@@ ach@@ om@@ achi famil@@ y' family and became one of the '@@ Ok@@ u eshi famil@@ y' families.
In addition, Yoshioki KANO (@@ ? - 163@@ 6) was not a blood relative of the Kano family, but he was given the family name of Kano by his third brother Tan@@ yu and later served the Kishu Tokugawa family.
On the other hand, there was a group called '@@ Kei@@ kan@@ ' that continued activities in Kyoto, and R@@ aku KANO (@@ 155@@ 9 - 163@@ 5) who was a disciple of E@@ itoku KA@@ NO, who was a disciple of E@@ itoku KA@@ NO.
San@@ raku came from the Kim@@ ura family, a vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and called himself Mitsu@@ yori KI@@ MURA.
The most important wall wall paintings of the Shinden of Daikaku-ji Temple in Kyoto and the picture of "@@ pe@@ on@@ y plum tre@@ e" and "@@ red plum tre@@ e" are painted in the garden of the Seiryo@@ den Hall of Daikaku-ji Temple in Kyoto and are decorated with decorative pict@@ ures.
S@@ ess@@ etsu KANO (@@ 158@@ 9 - 165@@ 1) was an adopted son of San@@ raku YAMA@@ ZA@@ KI@@ 's adopted son and his adopted son San@@ setsu KANO (@@ 169@@ 9 - 165@@ 1) was a wall painting of Myoshin-ji Temple, and there are still existing works such as Byo@@ bu (@@ folding scre@@ en) of Myoshin-ji Temple.
He had a unique style of painting painting among painters of the Kano school such as trees and rock@@ s, and he had a unique style of painting among the painters of the Kano school.
The book was compiled by his son Cho@@ an KANO (@@ 163@@ 1 - 169@@ 7) and is considered to have been the first full-scale painting history of Japanese paint@@ ing.
The Kob@@ ik@@ icho family included Ten@@ shin KANO (17@@ 30 - 17@@ 30@@ ), Ko@@ en KANO (@@ 175@@ 3 - 18@@ 18@@ ), E@@ ishin KANO (@@ 175@@ 3 - 18@@ 18@@ ), E@@ ishin KANO (@@ 185@@ 8 - 18@@ 18@@ ), E@@ in@@ en KANO (@@ 185@@ 8 - 18@@ 18@@ ) and Os@@ en KANO (@@ 185@@ 6 - 18@@ 18@@ 18@@ ) in the late Edo period.
Y@@ oshin YO@@ SHIKA@@ WA took the lead in the Kano School as the leader of the Kano school when the castle was destroyed by fire in 183@@ 8 and the hon@@ maru (main keep of a castle) of Edo-jo Castle and the hon@@ maru (main keep of a castle) of the Hon@@ maru (main keep of a castle) of Edo-jo Castle was rebuilt in 154@@ 4.
The wall paintings itself does not exist but are owned by Tokyo National Museum.
Har@@ us@@ awa-@@ in also made efforts to re@@ produce old paintings and collect@@ ion.
Although the study of the Kano school in the late Edo period was not highly evaluated as the painter of the Kano school in the late twent@@ i@@ eth century, Haru@@ yoshi SE@@ GAWA was a painter who was enthusi@@ ast@@ ically enthusi@@ astic about the study of Japanese paintings from classical paintings to new paintings in the latter half of the twent@@ i@@ eth century, and it has been recognized as a result of the re@@ evaluation of re@@ evalu@@ ation.
The disciples of Masanobu KANO (18@@ 23 - 188@@ 0) who was the next generation of H@@ iy@@ oshi@@ in, and the disciples of Masan@@ obu KANO (@@ born in Shimon@@ os@@ ek@@ i), who was a leading figure in the art of Japanese painting in the early Meiji period, and G@@ aho HASHI@@ MOTO (@@ born in the Kawag@@ oe River (@@ 185@@ 8 - 190@@ 8) and Masak@@ uni HASHI@@ MOTO (@@ born from 183@@ 5 to 190@@ 8).
Yoshitoshi and Masak@@ uni were from the Kano school of painters of the Kano school in the local area.
The Kano school as a group of professional pain@@ ters, ended with the end of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) which was a p@@ ip@@ e of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
The Emperor of Bas@@ ic Information
Emperor Shirakawa (July 7, 105@@ 3 - July 24, 112@@ 9) was the sevent@@ y-@@ second emperor of Japan.
His reign was from January 18, 107@@ 3 to January 5, 108@@ 7.
His imina (personal name) was Sad@@ achi@@ hito.
He was born as the first son of Emperor Gosan@@ jo who was a maternal relative of the Fujiwara clan and was a maternal relative of the Fujiwara clan, and his mother was a daughter of Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Kin@@ n@@ ari from the Kan@@ in line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and FUJIWARA no Shig@@ eko (@@ daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshin@@ obu@@ ), who was the adopted daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshin@@ ari, who was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshin@@ obu, who was the Togu no daibu (Master of the Crown Prince's Quar@@ ter@@ s).
Her younger sister was Imperial Princess Atsu@@ shi (@@ Empress of Emperor Horik@@ aw@@ a), who was the second consort of Emperor Horik@@ awa.
Family tree
Although he was treated c@@ old@@ ly with his son and son, he became Imperial Prince Sada@@ hito in 106@@ 8 when his father ascended to the throne.
In 106@@ 9, he became Crown Prince and was enthroned at the age of 20 in 106@@ 9.
Even after the Retired Emperor died in the following year, the Retired Emperor appointed the chief adviser to the Emperor, but even after the Retired Emperor died the following year, he tried to strengthen the power of the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regent@@ s) and so on to strengthen the power of the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regent@@ s).
Emperor Gosan@@ jo and Yom@@ e@@ imon@@ in, the real mother of Emperor Shirak@@ awa, had his younger brother Imperial Prince Sane@@ hito (@@ Heian Period@@ ) succeed to the throne, and Imperial Prince Sane@@ hito was designated as the younger brother of Imperial Prince Sane@@ hito at the time of his abdic@@ ation.
Emperor Shirakawa opposed this, but Imperial Prince Sane@@ hito died of illness in 108@@ 5.
In November 108@@ 6, Emperor Shirakawa did not have Imperial Prince Suke@@ hito and Emperor Shirak@@ awa, who was eight years old at the time of his enthron@@ ement, was installed as Crown Prince by his son, Imperial Prince Yoshi@@ hito (the sevent@@ y-@@ third Emperor Horik@@ aw@@ a), and he abdicated the throne on the same day.
The Retired Emperor Shirak@@ awa, who became Daijo Tenno (the retired Emperor), took political affairs as the Retired Emperor Shirak@@ aw@@ ain in order to protect the young emperor, and the so-called Insei (@@ rule by the retired emperor) appeared.
The post of Sessho Kanpaku continued to be established and it became close to the existence of the real exist@@ ence.
The Retired Emperor Shirakawa did not return to the government even after the Sei@@ jin-@@ shiki ceremony of the Emperor Horik@@ awa, and made a aut@@ oc@@ racy by using Z@@ uryo (the head of the provincial governors) and the samurai class.
Samurai were appointed to Hok@@ umen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Gu@@ ards for the north side) which was established as a guard of the retired emperor, and so on.
In 109@@ 6, when he was afraid of Buddhism, he became a priest and became a priest and became a priest and became a priest and became a priest and became a Cloistered Emperor.
He also made many temples and Buddha statu@@ es, such as Hos@@ sho-ji Temple, but his economic power was used to util@@ ize the economic power of zur@@ yo.

This is called '@@ Chiten no kimi (@@ retired emperor in power@@ ).'
The Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa said that '@@ the water of the Kamo-gawa River and the Kamo-gawa River (the flow of the Kamo-gawa River and the Kamo-gawa Riv@@ er) and a Sug@@ oroku (Japanese board game of sug@@ oroku (Japanese back@@ gam@@ mon@@ ), which was similar to that of the current Western gl@@ ance at that tim@@ e), were used as a means of gambl@@ ing and the movements of the monks of the Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt.

The Kujo family was one of the Sek@@ ke (@@ line of regents and advis@@ ers).
The founder was Kanezane KUJO, the third son of FUJIWARA no Tadam@@ ichi, who was the direct descendant of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan.
The name of the house was derived from the fact that he lived in Ku@@ jo-@@ don@@ o, which is said to have been founded by FUJIWARA no Motot@@ sun@@ e.
After the Meiji Restoration, he became a d@@ uk@@ e.
The kam@@ on (family crest@@ ) was Ku@@ j@@ if@@ uji KU@@ JO.
The descendants of FUJIWARA no Kane@@ zan@@ e, who was the younger brother of Kane@@ zan@@ e, were also included in the '@@ Kujo famil@@ y,' but the family line ended in the early stage.
Kanezane KUJO, the son of Michi@@ ie KUJO, the grandson of Kane@@ zan@@ e, and Sanet@@ sune KUJO became Sessho (@@ regent@@ ), and the Kujo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, and the Ichijo family, the Ichijo family, the Ichijo family, and the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Nijo family, the Ichijo family, and the Nijo family, were established the Gos@@ ek@@ ke (five families of regents and advis@@ ers).
Kanezane KUJO inherited the territory of Kok@@ am@@ onin and became the basis of the estate of the Kujo family.
The Taira clan and the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa were critical of the Taira clan government and became Sessho (@@ reg@@ ent) by the recommendation of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, and then Sessho (@@ reg@@ ent) and Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) from the Konoe family to the Kujo family and the Kujo family.
Michi@@ ie KUJO who was a grandson of Kane@@ zan@@ e, and his biological son Yorit@@ sune KUJO and his son Yorit@@ sugu KUJO took power in the Imperial Court as shogun of Sek@@ ke (@@ line of regents and advis@@ ers) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Kane@@ zan@@ e's diary "Gyoku@@ yo" is also well known.
In the middle of the Edo period, the territories of the Kujo family also spread further and in the Edo period, the hereditary stipend was increased to two thousand koku and later increased to 3,000 koku.
The fourth daughter of D@@ uk@@ e, Michi@@ taka KUJO and the fourth daughter of Michi@@ taka KUJO became the empress of Emperor Taisho (@@ Empress Te@@ im@@ ei@@ ).
The conflict between the Kujo family and the Ichijo family
Michi@@ ie KUJO was the legitimate son of Nor@@ in@@ ori KUJO, and his second son Yoshi@@ zane NIJO was the de fac@@ to ruler of the state.
Then, Michi@@ ie handed over the document to Tad@@ aie KUJO who was the son of the legitimate grandchild of Nor@@ iz@@ ane, who was the legitimate child of the legitimate child of Nor@@ izane and was the most important court noble at that time, but the head of the Ichijo family, who was the first son of T@@ of@@ uku@@ ji Temple, was the first son of Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO, and the first son of Sanet@@ sune KUJO, who was the first son of Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO, was the first son of Sanet@@ sune and the first son of the head of the family.
As a result, the descendants of Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO inherited the position of head of the family after Michi@@ ie died.
After that, the position of the direct descendant of the Ichijo family continued for more than 100 years and the position of the main branch of the Kujo family was established in the Kujo family of the Ichijo family.
In the Muromachi period, when Tsunem@@ ichi ICHIJO died in 136@@ 5, Tsunet@@ sune KUJO who was the next to the Ichijo family appealed to Emperor Gok@@ og@@ on, the son of Tsunem@@ ichi ICHIJO, who was the son of Tsunem@@ ichi ICHIJO, to call himself '@@ Choj@@ a choj@@ a.'
At that time, the eldest child succession system became common and the Kujo family, the eldest son of Michi@@ ie should be the direct descendant of the head of the family.
On the other hand, Fus@@ atsune ICHIJO was the heir of the Kujo family, and since Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO, who was the direct descendant of the Kujo family, was not able to take over the head of the family of the Kujo family, it was said that Sanet@@ sune KUJO was the heir of the Kujo family, and that it was a document handed down to the Kujo family, and that it was a document handed down from the Kujo family to the house of Michi@@ tomi to the Kujo family, and that it was a child of Nor@@ izane KUJO who was a young man of the Kujo family, and that it was not the successor to the Kujo family, and that the family had no choice but to succeed to the family est@@ ate.
The reason for the punishment was that Tad@@ aie KUJO (@@ execut@@ or of the will of the will of the Shogun@@ ) became a temporary head of the Kujo family, and the fact that the land rights of the Tofuku-ji Temple had been handed down to the Kujo family and the Kujo family was the main branch of the Kujo family, which was said to be the fact that the Kujo family was a direct descendant of the Kujo family.
On the other hand, the Emperor issued rin@@ ji (imperial decre@@ e) to the Kujo family at the time of the Kujo family, and on November 29 of the same year, Michi@@ ie was allowed to succeed the head of the family, and it was decided that the Kujo family and the Ichijo family were the main branch of the family.
In the Kamakura period, the Ichijo family was the direct descendant of the Kujo family, but after the middle of the Muromachi period, the position of the Kujo family became more dominant and the Ichijo family and the Kujo family were regarded as the direct descendant of the Kujo family.
After the middle of the Edo period, the Kujo family, which was the largest Kok@@ udaka (@@ ass@@ essed yield@@ ) of the Matsu@@ dono family, had a large residence and insisted that it was the direct descendant of the Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu school.

The major buildings such as M@@ oya were relocated to the residence of Ku@@ jo-@@ tei in Tokyo in the early Meiji period, and in recent years it was donated to Tokyo National Museum of Fine Art@@ s, and it was named Ku@@ jo-@@ kan@@ .
Yamashiro Province was one of the ry@@ osei@@ koku (@@ provinces governed by provincial government offic@@ es), which was originally a local administrative division in Japan and was located in the Kinai region (@@ provinces surrounding Kyoto and Nar@@ a).
It is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
His another name was J@@ oshu (also known as San@@ shu or San@@ shu or San@@ shu@@ ), and he was also called Y@@ osh@@ u.
In the Engishiki (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and pray@@ ers), the rank of kokushi was classified into kok@@ ushi.
In ancient times, '@@ yam@@ ashi@@ ro@@ ' was written as 山@@ 城@@ , and the country was built in the seventh century.
When the capital was named on December 8, 79@@ 4, Emperor Kanmu changed its name from Yamashiro to Yamashiro Province because the mountain river was located in the coll@@ ar with its coll@@ ar.
As the mok@@ kan (@@ mok@@ kan@@ ) in the period of Heijo-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nar@@ a), it seems to have been written as 山@@ 城@@ 国@@ , 山@@ <unk> 国@@ , and 山@@ 国@@ 国@@ .
Kokufu was established in the Japanese name Ru@@ i@@ ju Ru@@ i@@ ju Ru@@ i@@ ju@@ sho (@@ dictionary of Japanese nam@@ es).
According to Shug@@ ai@@ sho, it is described as Ot@@ okun@@ i-@@ gun and Gun@@ .
Setsu@@ yo@@ shu (@@ revised edition@@ ) (@@ revised edition of the Book of E@@ qu@@ ino@@ x and revised edition@@ ) says that it was located in '@@ Keicho E@@ ir@@ in-@@ shi@@ ,' and it was written as "@@ Ot@@ okun@@ i-@@ gun@@ " and "@@ Gun@@ -@@ fu@@ " in the end of Ok@@ u-@@ no-@@ sho (a collection of enc@@ ycl@@ oped@@ i@@ a).
The Shug@@ osho was originally the residence of gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods) who served as Shugo (provincial constable) of Yamashiro Province.
After that, Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Roku@@ hara, Kyoto) was concurrently appointed to the post of Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Roku@@ hara, Kyoto).
In the Muromachi period, Yamashiro Province was divided into three coun@@ ties and five coun@@ ties and five coun@@ ties in the direction of the Uji-gawa River, and since the shug@@ osho (provincial constable) of Kam@@ is@@ ami County was assigned to the shug@@ odai (deputy of shug@@ o, provincial constable) of three coun@@ ties and five coun@@ ties and five coun@@ ties were placed at Mak@@ ishim@@ a Island of U@@ ji.
Ichin@@ omiya, Koku@@ bun@@ -ji Temple
Koku@@ bun@@ -ji Temple was located in Sor@@ aku@@ -gun and nun@@ n@@ ery temples.
Kun@@ inomiya Dai@@ gok@@ uden was designated as a Buddhist temple in 74@@ 6.
It was burnt down in 88@@ 2.
After that, it was re@@ construc@@ ted, but it fell into declin@@ e.
It seems to have been a branch temple of Byo@@ do@@ in Temple in the Kamakura period.
The place is located in present-day Kam@@ o-cho, Kizugawa City.
In 192@@ 5, a large number of old roof tiles were excavated in the buckwheat noodles of Koku@@ bun@@ -ji Temple and it is considered to have been the site of nun@@ n@@ ery temples.
In the Engishiki Jin@@ myo@@ cho (a list of deities) of the Engishiki (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and pray@@ ers), there are 3@@ 7@@ 7 taisha (@@ grand shrin@@ es), 6@@ 9 sh@@ a@@ sha and 6@@ 9 sh@@ a@@ sha in tot@@ al, and 3@@ 9@@ 6 in tot@@ al, 36 in tot@@ al, 36 za in the Imperial Court, and 3 major za in Kyoto were listed in tot@@ al.

It is thought that the Ichin@@ omiya in Yamashiro Province was designated as Ichin@@ omiya in order to distinguish it from the provinces of the province, and in the Kinai region (@@ provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto) it was decided that Jingikan was established in accordance with the establishment of Ichin@@ omiya in various provinces from the end of the eleventh century to the beginning of the 12th century.

The Iked@@ aya Incident was an incident in which Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunat@@ e), who was under the control of Kyoto Shug@@ oshoku (M@@ ilitary governor of Kyoto), attacked the Sonno Joi (@@ 19th century sl@@ ogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreign@@ ers), was attacked by Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunat@@ e).
It is also said that the Iked@@ aya Incident, the Iked@@ aya Incident and the Sanjo-@@ o@@ hashi Bridge Incident.
Isami KONDO called himself Raku@@ yo no R@@ an (@@ war between Lu@@ oy@@ ang and Lu@@ oy@@ ang@@ ).
In the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, Kyoto became the center of political affairs, and many of the R@@ onin (@@ masterless samurai) who had thought of Sonno Joi (@@ reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreign@@ ers) and the pro-@@ Imperial Court such as Sonno Joi (@@ 19th century sl@@ ogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreign@@ ers).
The Choshu clan was over@@ thrown due to the Coup of August 18 which occurred between the Aizu clan and the Satsuma clan, and the Imperial Court became the main@@ stream@@ .
The Son@@ no-@@ jo@@ i (@@ supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and exp@@ elling the barbari@@ ans) tried to reg@@ ain power, and the Kyoto shug@@ oshoku (M@@ ilitary governor of Kyoto) had to protect the city of Kyoto by using Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunat@@ e).
Around the late May, Su@@ sum@@ u YAMA@@ ZAKI and Kai SHIMA@@ DA who were in charge of miscellaneous duties and inspect@@ ors of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) reported the existence of Masu@@ ya (@@ Tak@@ achi@@ taro FURU@@ FURU@@ TAKA@@ ) who managed fire@@ wood and fire@@ works in Shim@@ oj@@ oj@@ oj@@ im@@ achi (@@ Ko@@ be@@ -@@ machi, Shi@@ j@@ oj@@ oj@@ oj@@ im@@ achi Town@@ ) and others in the vicinity of Shi@@ j@@ oj@@ oj@@ im@@ achi (@@ Ko@@ be@@ -@@ bashi Bridg@@ e) and reported it to the Aizu Domain.
The letters with weapons and the Choshu clan were discover@@ ed.
The Shinsengumi captured Furu@@ ichi no Tak@@ a, and Toshizo HIJI@@ KA@@ TA, tor@@ tured the old Takat@@ omo FURU@@ KAWA by tor@@ turing Toshizo HIJI@@ KATA@@ .
The plan was planned to set fire to the Kyoto Imperial Palace by setting fire to the Kyoto Imperial Palace which had a strong influence of the Gion Matsuri Festival, and the Imperial Prince Asa@@ hiko NAKA@@ GAWA (later Imperial Prince Asa@@ hik@@ o, Imperial Prince Asa@@ hik@@ o) confined the Imperial Prince Asa@@ hiko NAKA@@ GAWA (later Imperial Prince Asa@@ hiko KU@@ NI@@ NO@@ MIYA who later became Imperial Prince Asa@@ hik@@ o) to assassin@@ ate Yoshinobu HI@@ TO@@ TSU@@ BA@@ SHI and Kat@@ amori MATSUDAIRA of Aiz@@ u.
In addition, the Son@@ no-@@ ha group such as the Choshu clan and the Higo Domain was arrested by FURU@@ KO no Tak@@ a, the Choshu clan and the Higo Domain, and the meeting was held at Iked@@ aya or Shikoku in the Shikoku region.
The Shinsengumi asked the Aizu Domain and the Kuwana Domain to support them, but the movement of Aizu and others was not mov@@ ed.
For this reason, Isami KON@@ DO, who was the leader of the head of the Shinsengum@@ i, was forced to take part in an independent act@@ ion, and the Kondo and Hi@@ jik@@ at@@ a's troops started to search for the two groups of Kondo and Hi@@ jik@@ at@@ a.
At that time, there were few people who were sick in the Shinsengum@@ i, and there were only ten members of the Kondo and 24 members of the Hi@@ jik@@ ata troop of the Kondo and 24 members of the Hi@@ jik@@ ata troop@@ , and there were only 34 members of the Shinsengumi members (@@ though there are different the@@ ori@@ es).
The Shinsengumi led by Hi@@ jik@@ ata from Yasak@@ a-jinja Shrine and crossed the Sanjo-@@ o@@ hashi Bridge with Hi@@ jik@@ at@@ a-@@ dori Street and planned to search for Tak@@ iy@@ a-@@ dori Street.
After the se@@ arch@@ ing, Kondo discovered the radical Sonno Joi ha (@@ supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and exp@@ elling the barbari@@ ans) party in Iked@@ aya in the plot of the plot to assassin@@ ate.
The Kondo troop was killed by a few soldiers and became a battle during the night.
In contrast with the extrem@@ ists of Sonno Joi (@@ principle advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreign@@ ers), there were four members of Isami KON@@ DO, Soji OKI@@ TA, Shinp@@ achi NAGA@@ KURA, Shin@@ suke NAGA@@ KURA, Hei@@ suke TO@@ DO, and Hei@@ suke TO@@ DO.
The ro@@ shi (@@ masterless samurai) such as Hay@@ at@@ aro A@@ NDO and Ei@@ suke OKU@@ ZAWA, who had def@@ ected to the back of the back and ran away to escape from the enemy and ran away.
As a result, Ok@@ us@@ awa died and A@@ NDO and Nitta died one month later.
Ok@@ ita who had been in the house fought brav@@ ely, but he was defeated in the battle and left the front line.
There is a theory that this was caused by lun@@ g tub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is, but it is not certain whether there are various quest@@ ions.
In addition, T@@ odo TO@@ DO who was on the first flo@@ or, had a sword with a sword with a sword and was shot by a sword and left the front line.
Although he became two of Kondo and Nag@@ akura for a while, the army of Hi@@ jik@@ at@@ a's troops was on advant@@ ageous level@@ , and four soldiers were arrested in the Shinsengumi due to the arrival of Hi@@ jik@@ at@@ a's army.
The support of the Aizu and Kuwana clans arrived after the battle.
It is said that Hi@@ jik@@ ata could not be able to move his sword to the point that he could not move even if he was able to move his hand@@ s.
In this battle, several members of the Sonno Joi (@@ sl@@ ogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreign@@ ers) escaped in the battle, but they cooperated with the Aizu Domain and Kuwana Domain in the following year and captured more than twenty members in cooperation with the Aizu Domain and the Kuwana Domain.
In addition, the Satsuma clan fought fierc@@ ely and the Aizu clan consisted of five members and four members of the Hikone Domain and four people of the Kuwana Domain were killed.
On the following day, he returned to his residence in Mibu village because he was afraid of being killed in the night.
It is said that he was fond of the spect@@ er on the stre@@ et.
The name of Shinsengum@@ i, which succeeded in def@@ ending the plan to set fire to the Imperial Palace, was widely used in the whole country.
On the other hand, the Son@@ no-@@ jo@@ i group was killed by the powerful persons such as Minoru YOSHIDA, Kit@@ sur@@ um@@ amar@@ o, Tei@@ zo KITA@@ GA@@ MI, Mat@@ ajiro O@@ TAKA@@ BE, Jun@@ jiro SUGI@@ YAMA, Matsu@@ suke SUGI@@ YAMA and Shige@@ suke MATSU@@ DA who were killed in the battle, and they were greatly damaged by the new government (the new government was called 'the Seven R@@ ul@@ es of W@@ arri@@ or@@ .'
Although Kog@@ oro KATSURA (later Takayoshi KI@@ DO@@ ) was supposed to have been in the sp@@ ot, it was difficult to escape due to the fact that it was too early to wait for a long time.
As a result of this incident, the Choshu clan raised an army and went up to the capital (@@ Kyoto) in the form of a hard@@ -@@ lin@@ er fact@@ ion, and the Kin@@ mon Incident occurred on July 19.
Due to the Iked@@ aya Incident, it is also said that the Meiji Restoration was del@@ ayed one year after the Iked@@ aya Incident, and that the Sonno Joi ha (@@ supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and exp@@ elling the barbari@@ ans) was st@@ opp@@ ed.
Ryo@@ taro SHIBA, a novel@@ ist, interpreted that the main character of the Satsuma and Choshu clans did not have this incident.

In "@@ Ogura Hyakunin Is@@ shu" (The Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tank@@ a-@@ poems by One Hundred Poet@@ s), he was selected for the first half of the night in the night of the night saying '@@ There is no one to see the moon in the mo@@ on@@ .'
She was from the Fujiwara clan and her nyo@@ bo (a court lad@@ y) was '@@ FUJI@@ WARA@@ .'
The name '@@ Murasaki no u@@ e' is derived from '@@ Murasaki no u@@ e' (@@ Murasaki no u@@ e) written by Murasaki no ue, who was a person in the work of "The Tale of Genji@@ ," and his father was Shikibu tai@@ jo (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Ceremon@@ ial@@ ).
Although the real name Murasaki Shikibu is unknown, there is a theory that it is '@@ FUJIWARA no Tak@@ ak@@ o' who is said to have been a person who served as a servant in the article of '@@ On@@ do Kanp@@ ak@@ uk@@ i' (@@ diary of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) and Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor).
However, there are many cases in which this theory has been fixed and there are criticism that there are some err@@ ors in the process of the theory, and there are criticism that there are some err@@ ors of the fact@@ s.
Although the year of his birth and death are not known, it is assumed that he died in around 100@@ 8 when he was 30 years old, and it is assumed that he died around 10@@ 16.
Although there is a story that he was fond of lov@@ ing s@@ aw@@ ashi in the noble class, it is said that he was a story of Izumi Shikibu in '@@ Sar@@ uta@@ hik@@ o' (a story of a story of a young man of the Minamoto clan) and it is thought that he was a story of a story in the later ages.
He was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tamet@@ oki who was Echigo no kuni no kami (Governor of Echigo Province), and his mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tam@@ en@@ obu, who was Settsu no kuni no kami (Governor of Settsu Province), but it is said that his mother died when Murasaki Shikibu was young.
FUJIWARA no Kore@@ n@@ ori, who was his maternal half-@@ brother, was also known as the existence of his elder sist@@ er.
FUJIWARA no Sadak@@ ata, Udaijin (minister of the right) and Chunagon FUJIWARA no Kane@@ suke TSUTSU@@ MI were both his grand@@ father@@ -in-law and many people heard about the letter from his father.
Since his child@@ hood, he had a lot of anecdotes as a talented woman since he was a young wom@@ an, and he read kan@@ bun (@@ classical Chines@@ e) and read Chinese characters, so that he had a lot of anecdotes as a talented wom@@ an.
It is generally believed that he wrote "@@ Tale of Genji" and "@@ Murasaki Shikibu Di@@ ary@@ ," a diary diary of the Imperial Court serving five chap@@ ters, and "@@ Murasaki Shikibu Di@@ ary@@ ," which is a collection of personal collection of poetry "@@ Murasaki Shiki@@ bu@@ " (The Tale of Murasaki Shiki@@ bu@@ ).
His father FUJIWARA no Tamet@@ oki took the role of reading books for the Crown Prince and became Kurodo (Ch@@ amberlain) and Shikibu tai@@ jo (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Ceremon@@ i@@ al) when the Crown Prince became Emperor Kaz@@ an, he lost his position when Emperor Kazan entered the priesthood.
In 10@@ 10, he was appointed as Z@@ uryo (the head of the provincial governors) of Echizen Province by Emperor Ichi@@ jo.
Murasaki Shikibu spent about two years in his life and his father was appointed to the post of his father.
Around 99@@ 8, he married FUJIWARA no Nobu@@ taka, Yamashiro no kuni no kami (the governor of Yamashiro Province), who had a difference between his father and son, and in 99@@ 9, he had a daughter FUJIWARA no Masak@@ o, who had a daughter of the first daughter of FUJIWARA no Masak@@ o, and gave birth to a son, FUJIWARA no Ken@@ shi (@@ Dain@@ i no San@@ mi [@@ third highest of the eight hereditary tit@@ l@@ es@@ ]), but his marriage was not long and he died in a short life.
It seems that he served as nyo@@ bo (a close female relative of the Emperor or a woman of comparable stand@@ ing) to FUJIWARA no Shoshi (the eldest daughter of FUJIWARA no Michin@@ ag@@ a), who was the second consort of Emperor Ichi@@ jo, and served as nyo@@ in (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable stand@@ ing) at least until around 100@@ 8.
The waka collected in "@@ kot@@ oba Wakashu (Collection of Flow@@ ering Fort@@ un@@ es@@ )," which was included in the collection of Ise no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of the Sovereign@@ 's Household) in "@@ On@@ shi Wakashu" (@@ collection of Japanese poem@@ s), was a collection of waka that was composed by Murasaki Shiki@@ bu, who was given the title of Chugu (the second consort of an emperor) when he was presented to the Imperial Court, but according to the "@@ Ise no Tai@@ fu@@ " (The Tales of Ise@@ ), the role of Murasaki Shikibu was changed to Shikibu no Tai@@ fu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Central Affair@@ s).
According to the entry of the diary of FUJIWARA no Sane@@ suke in "Sh@@ oy@@ uki" (Diary of FUJIWARA no Sane@@ suk@@ e) dated May 25, 10@@ 22 in the diary of FUJIWARA no Sane@@ suke, there is a description that he was the last person who served as the Empress Dowager and Empress Dowager Shok@@ o.
Therefore, it is generally believed that he died between 10@@ 11 and 10@@ 16, but there is a different view that he died in 10@@ 16.
The tomb of Murasaki Shikibu is located in Murasak@@ ino Hig@@ ashin@@ ot@@ a-cho, Kita Ward, Kyoto City (@@ west of Horik@@ awa-@@ hig@@ ashi-@@ hig@@ ashi@@ )
At present, a small portrait and a part of "@@ Genji Monogatari Emak@@ i" are used on the back of the Bank of Japan D@@ D@@ D@@ Y@@ , and a part of "@@ Genji Monogatari Emak@@ i" (@@ picture scroll of the Tale of Genji@@ ).
He is the only person who is listed in the United N@@ ations Educ@@ ation@@ al, Sci@@ ent@@ ific and Education, C@@ ulture, S@@ por@@ ts, Science and Technology (@@ = the United N@@ ations Educ@@ ation@@ al, Sci@@ ent@@ ific and Education, C@@ ulture, S@@ por@@ ts, Science and Techn@@ olog@@ ies) as a Japanese person in the Japanese history.
It is also known as a nyo@@ bo (a court lad@@ y) who was famous for the same period.
The most famous example is Sei Shonagon (@@ less@@ er councilor of state) who was the author of "M@@ akura no s@@ oshi" (The P@@ ill@@ ow Book@@ ) (@@ here@@ in@@ after it was translated as follow@@ s).
Although he wrote his real name (@@ kanji (Chinese character@@ s), he often wrote '@@ Even though there is no doubt that he was a good person, he was a great person, and he had to write it in his face without any mistak@@ e@@ ', and he wrote "@@ Murasaki no U@@ e no U@@ e no Shi@@ ran@@ ami" (The Story of Murasaki Shiki@@ bu@@ ) and "@@ Murasaki no U@@ e no U@@ e no U@@ e no U@@ e no U@@ e no Shi@@ " (The Story of Murasaki Shiki@@ bu@@ ).
I could like to say that I would like to be able to be able to go back to you@@ ' (@@ "K@@ uro@@ kawa Nikki" (The Tale of the Kuro@@ kawa Riv@@ er)
In addition, he is a critical critic@@ , which can be said to be almost the same thing as that of the un@@ iv@@ er@@ se.
These expressions have been written up to recent years, and they have been interested in various things such as the fact that Murasaki Shikibu had been j@@ eal@@ ous@@ y for the talent of Sei Shonagon (@@ less@@ er councilor of state).
However, it is considered that the age of both of his or her father and the period of serving the Imperial Court was slightly different from that of the age of 10@@ 10, and it is considered that he did not have any knowled@@ g@@ e.
He was loved by Izumi Shikibu who was a female waka poet of the same school (@@ though his poems are not good@@ , but his poems are described as '@@ eleg@@ ant@@ ' and so on) and Ak@@ az@@ ome E@@ mon@@ .
According to "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continu@@ ed), Emperor Ichi@@ jo, who had read "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji@@ ), praised the author and praised the writ@@ ing, and then he read it in the "Nihon Shok@@ i" (Chronicles of Japan) (@@ According to "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continu@@ ed) there is a theory that it was written in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) that it was written in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
For this reason, there is an anecdote that he was nickn@@ amed '@@ Nihon Ki no tsub@@ on@@ e' (The Bureau of Japanese Chron@@ ic@@ l@@ es), but there is a theory that it was a popular theory that he was a f@@ ic@@ tit@@ ious man who had a hard time to read kan@@ bun (@@ classical Japanese langu@@ age) and it is said that he was suffering from his own life.
In "@@ Eiga Monogatari" (The Tale of Flow@@ ering Fort@@ un@@ es), some descriptions of Murasaki no ue and Murasaki no di@@ ari@@ es, there is a story that Michinaga came to see her in the night.
According to "Son@@ pi Bunmy@@ aku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocrac@@ y), which was a collection of court nobles in the Kamakura period, there is a description that '@@ Murasaki Shikibu was a court lady of Jot@@ om@@ onin (a court lady of the first rank) Murasaki Shiki@@ bu, who was a poet of the Tale of Genji and was a daughter of Murasaki Shikibu who was a real author of "The Tale of Genji@@ ," but the details of the relationship between Michinaga and Michinaga and his mist@@ ress was unclear@@ .

The current chairman is Ken@@ zan AKI@@ YAMA.
He also supported the performances of theat@@ ers which were based on the theme of the Tale of Genji, and published the following books.

Takauji ASHIKAGA (@@ 130@@ 5 - 135@@ 8) was a busho (Japanese military commander) from the late Kamakura period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts.
He was the first Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
His real family name was Genji (Minamoto clan).
He was born as the legitimate son of Sad@@ au@@ ji ASHIKAGA, who was the direct descendant of the Ashikaga clan of the Kawachi-Genji (Minamoto clan).
At first he was given the name of Tak@@ au@@ ji by Takat@@ oki HOJO, who was the regent of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and called himself Tak@@ au@@ ji.
In 133@@ 3, when Emperor Godaigo raised an army at Mt. Hok@@ i, he led the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) as a powerful gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), but he raised an army against the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and destroyed Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Roku@@ hara, Kyoto).
He was regarded as the first person who distinguished himself in the fall of the bakufu, and was given one character from Taka@@ har@@ u, the posthumous name of Emperor Godaigo and changed his name to Takau@@ ji.
While the Kenmu Restoration was gradually weak@@ ened by Godaigo's aut@@ oc@@ rac@@ y, the Kenmu Restoration led to the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and established its own political power in Kamakura after suppres@@ sing the Nakas@@ endai War.
As a result of this, the relationship between the Imperial Court and the Imperial Court became wor@@ se, and Godaigo temporarily fled to Mt. Hiei and fled to Kyushu, but he fled to Kyushu due to a counter@@ attack by the Emperor Godaigo's force.
He went up to Kyoto again from Kyushu, and established a new military government (@@ = the Muromachi bakufu [@@ Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun@@ ]) by the Retired Emperor Kog@@ on and Emperor Kom@@ yo.
Godaigo moved to Yoshino and established the Southern Court (Japan).
After the establishment of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), his younger brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA and the second head of the government, but later they were opposed to Tadayoshi and the Kanno Disturb@@ ance.
The war ended with the death of Taday@@ oshi, but he continued to conquer anti-@@ shogunate forces such as the Southern Court, and made efforts to stabil@@ ize the country.
After Godaigo passed away, he built Ten@@ ryu-ji Temple to pray to Buddha for the repose of his soul@@ .
After the Meiji period when Emperor Godaigo raised an army against the Emperor, he was regarded as a rebel@@ , but since the Meiji period it was considered as a rebel@@ , the image of the person was greatly changed due to the changes of historical view@@ s.
The fall of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)
Takauji was born in 130@@ 5.
There are three theories regarding his birth@@ place, one is that he was born in Ayabe (in Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture) and the other is that he was born in Kamakura and the other is that he was born in Ashikaga no sho (@@ Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture).
According to "@@ Tai@@ hei Taihei@@ ki" (The Record of the Great Peac@@ e), when Takauji was born to his birth@@ place, Yam@@ ah@@ a was shot by Yam@@ aga in his shoulder and one h@@ aba was put up on the shoulder of Takau@@ ji.
His childhood name was Mat@@ at@@ aro.
On November 10, 13@@ 19, when he was 15 years old, he celebrated his attain@@ ment of man@@ hood and was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Ji@@ bu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of Popular Affair@@ s), while he was granted the name of Takat@@ oki HOJO, the regent of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
His father Sad@@ au@@ ji and his lawful wife Shak@@ a-do (@@ daughter of Akit@@ oki HO@@ JO@@ ) were the eldest son of Yoshitaka ASHIKAGA, but Tak@@ au@@ ji succeeded to the head of the family.
According to "Taihei@@ ki" (The Record of the Great Peac@@ e), the grandfather of Takau@@ ji, Iet@@ oki ASHIKAGA, who was the grandfather of Takau@@ ji, committed suicide with his own sword.
In 133@@ 1, Emperor Godaigo planned to overthrow the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and raised an army in Kasag@@ i.
The Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) ordered the Tak@@ au@@ ji clan, who was a senior vassal of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and Tak@@ au@@ ji participated in the attack on Kas@@ agi and Shimot@@ ak@@ asak@@ a-jo Castle which were based on Masashige KUSUNO@@ KI.
At that time, his father Sad@@ au@@ ji died immediately after the death of his father, Sad@@ au@@ ji, and the Taka@@ uji clan declin@@ ed, but the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) appointed his wife as host@@ ages and his wife as host@@ age.
According to "@@ Shok@@ oku Taihei@@ ki" (The Record of the Great Peac@@ e), Tak@@ au@@ ji came to have ant@@ agon@@ ism against the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
As a result of the attack of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), many court nobles, such as Toshi@@ moto HI@@ NO and En@@ kan who were involved in the overthrow of the bakufu, were captured by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and sent to Oki Island in the following year (@@ Genko War).
The bakufu supported Emperor Godaigo of the Daik@@ akuji-@@ to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kamey@@ am@@ a) of the Daik@@ akuji-@@ to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kamey@@ am@@ a) to support Emperor Godaigo of the Daik@@ akuji-@@ to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kamey@@ am@@ a).
In 133@@ 3, the following year, Emperor Godaigo escaped from Oki Island and confined himself in Mt. Fun@@ ak@@ ami.
Tak@@ au@@ ji again received an order from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and went up to Kyoto with kok@@ e NA@@ GO@@ E in order to suppress the anti-@@ shogunate forces in Saigoku (@@ western part of Japan (@@ es@@ p. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kin@@ ki@@ ).
As kok@@ e NA@@ GO@@ E was killed by Norim@@ ura AKA@@ MATSU, Tak@@ au@@ ji decided to make Emperor Godaigo's order, and on April 29, 133@@ 4, Tak@@ au@@ ji raised an army against the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at Shin@@ om@@ ura Hachiman-gu Shrine in Tanba Province (@@ Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture).
He sent many troops to various provinces, and entered Kyoto with the gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods) such as Doyo SASAKI in Omi Province, and destroyed Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Roku@@ hara, Kyoto).
During the same period, Yoshisada NIT@@ TA, who was a gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods) of Kozuke Province, raised an army and advanced his army to Kamakura with Sen@@ ju@@ o (later Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA@@ ) who had escaped from Kamakura to Kamakura by the legitimate child of Tak@@ au@@ ji and destroyed the bakufu.
At that time Tak@@ au@@ 's concub@@ ine, Chiku@@ wak@@ amar@@ u, was killed during the conf@@ us@@ ion.
After the fall of the Kamakura bakufu, the Tak@@ au@@ ji clan sent Kazu@@ uji HOSOKAWA, Yori@@ haru HOSOKAWA, and Mor@@ ouji HOSOKAWA, and sent Yoshi@@ s@@ ada's brothers to the capital and took the control of the Ashikaga army.
After the fall of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the Tak@@ au@@ ji clan was regarded as the first person who distinguished himself from the Emperor Godaigo and was appointed Chinju-fu shogun (@@ Commander-in-@@ Chief of the Defense of the Nor@@ th) and Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Sahyoe no kami (Captain of the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards).
In addition, he changed his name to Takauji from his imina (@@ real name of a person who has been given the name of a person who has been given the name of a person who has been given the name of a person who has been given the name of a person who has been given the name of a person who has been given the name of a person who has been given the name of a noble person@@ ) of the Emperor.
Takauji was in the center of the Kenmu government and sent KO no Moron@@ ao, KO no Moron@@ ao, KO no Moronao and KO no Mor@@ oyasu who were the steward of the Ashikaga family, and his younger brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA as the regent of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
There is a view that this was because Emperor Godaigo respected Takauji and thought that Takauji would have been a distance between the government and the government.
There is also a theory that he had an intention to establish the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) by the imperial proclamation of Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians@@ ").
This situation was said to be '@@ not Takauji who had no intention to overthrow the new government@@ .'
When Emperor Godaigo appointed Aki@@ ie KITABATAKE to Chinju-fu shogun (@@ Commander-in-@@ Chief of the Defense of the Nor@@ th) and appointed him to the post of Chinju-fu shogun (@@ Commander-in-@@ Chief of the Defense of the Nor@@ th), Takauji ordered Imperial Prince Mun@@ en@@ ari (later Emperor Gom@@ urak@@ ami) to go to Oshu Chin@@ zei Chin@@ zei (@@ Northern part of the Kanto region) and sent his young son Imperial Prince Nar@@ iy@@ oshi.
Imperial Prince Mor@@ iy@@ oshi, who was a prince of Emperor Godaigo and also Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the same time, was opposed to Takauji and tried to assassin@@ ate Takau@@ ji, but he did not have any support of Takau@@ ji.
In 133@@ 4, Takauji had a connection with Masako A@@ NO, who was a favorite of the Emperor Godaigo as Crown Prince, and captured Imperial Prince Mor@@ iy@@ oshi, who had a conflict with the Emperor Godaigo and confined him to Tadayoshi in Kamakura.
In 133@@ 5, the Nakas@@ endai War broke out in Shinano Province, where the Nakas@@ endai War, which was a rebellion by the Hojo clan who supported Tok@@ iyuki HOJO, the bereaved child of Takat@@ oki HOJO, and Tok@@ iy@@ uk@@ i's army occupied Kamakura tempor@@ ar@@ ily.
On this occasion, Tadayoshi killed Imperial Prince Mor@@ iy@@ oshi.
Takauji had no choice but to appoint Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Emperor Godaigo to the throne, and on August 2 of the same year, the Emperor Godaigo ordered Kamakura to go to Kamakura without permission and gave the title of Se@@ ito taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians") to be granted the title of Se@@ ito taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians@@ ").
Takauji joined the army of Tadayoshi and expelled Tok@@ iyuki in the Battle of Sagami and recovered Kamakura on the same day.
Takauji was raised to Junii (Junior Second Rank).
Because of the intention of Taday@@ oshi, Takauji established his home base in Kamakura and started to show his original movement to establish a samurai government based on the intention of Taday@@ oshi.
In November of the same year, Takauji reported the subjugation of Yoshisada NITTA to the Emperor Godaigo as a tr@@ ait@@ or, but the Emperor Godaigo ordered Yoshisada to sub@@ due the punitive force and ordered Takauji to sub@@ due the Kamakura bakufu to sub@@ due the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and ordered the Kamakura bakufu to go to Kamakura.
In addition, Aki@@ ie KITABATAKE in Oshu (@@ Northern Hon@@ shu, Mutsu Province) also declared his retire@@ ment, but when Takauji was defeated in various places such as Tadayoshi and KO no Moronao in Mikawa Province, Takauji decided to overthrow the Kenmu government.
In December of the same year, Takauji defeated the Nitta army in the Battle of Hak@@ one and Taken@@ oshi@@ ta and started advancing to Kyoto.
During this period, Takauji made contact with Emperor Kog@@ on of Jim@@ yo@@ in-@@ to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofuk@@ akusa to Emperor Gokom@@ atsu) and made an effort to gain the legitim@@ acy of the army of Kyoto.
On the New Year's day of the first year of the Kenmu Restoration, Takauji entered the capital and Emperor Godaigo retreated to Mt. Hi@@ ei.
However, in February of the same year, Takauji met Aki@@ ie KITABATAKE and Yoshisada NIT@@ TA, who went to the capital from Oshu (@@ Northern Hon@@ shu, the region en@@ compass@@ ing Mutsu and Dewa provinc@@ es) and joined the off@@ ensive attack by Masashige KUSUNOKI and Yoshisada NIT@@ TA, and went to Kyushu to persu@@ ade En@@ shin AKA@@ MATSU@@ .
On the way to Kyushu, he was welcomed by Yorin@@ ao SHO@@ NI@@ , who was in Ak@@ ah@@ ama, Nagato Province (@@ Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), and was supported by the Mun@@ akata clan of Mun@@ akata Taisha Shrine in Chikuzen Province.
In the early March, after Mun@@ akata Taisha Shrine, Takauji defeated Taket@@ oshi KIKU@@ CHI of the side of Emperor Godaigo in the Battle of Tat@@ ar@@ ah@@ ama, Chikuzen Province (@@ Higashi Ward, Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture) in the Battle of Tat@@ ar@@ ah@@ ama, and in the middle of the third month he received an in@@ zen (a decree from the retired Emperor) from the Retired Emperor Godaigo in Kyoto and gained the support of the Retired Emperor Kog@@ en in the Battle of Tat@@ ar@@ ah@@ ama, and entered the eastern part of Japan.
He defeated Yoshisada NITTA and Masashige KUSUNOKI in the Battle of Min@@ at@@ og@@ awa, and conquered Kyoto again in June of the same year.
Takau@@ ji, who came to Kyoto, requested to reconcil@@ e with Emperor Godaigo who had fled to Mt. Hi@@ ei.
Emperor Godaigo gave up the sacred treasures to Emperor Komyo who was the younger brother of the Retired Emperor Kog@@ on, and on November 7, 133@@ 6, Takauji decided to establish the Kenmu government and declared the establishment of a new government to establish a new government.
On the other hand, in December of the same year, Emperor Godaigo escaped from Kyoto and fled to Yoshino (@@ Yoshin@@ o-cho, Yoshin@@ o-@@ gun, Nara Prefecture) and established the Yoshino Imperial Court.
In 133@@ 8, Takauji was appointed Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") by Emperor Komyo (@@ 133@@ 8 - 135@@ 8) and later the military government called Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was established based on the real name.
In the following year, when Emperor Godaigo died in Yoshin@@ o, Takauji started construction of Ten@@ ryu-ji Temple for the repose of his soul@@ .
The Ten@@ ryu-ji Temple ship was dispatched to the Yuan Dynasty (@@ dynast@@ y) for the cost of the construction cost@@ .
In the new government, Takauji appointed Tadayoshi to the position of the head of the samurai who was in charge of affairs of state and was appointed to the position of the ruler of the country.
Shin@@ ichi SATO praised this situation in "@@ Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (@@ Iwanami Shot@@ en, Iwanami Shot@@ en, Iwanami Shot@@ en, 196@@ 3, Iwanami Shot@@ en, 196@@ 3, Iwanami Shot@@ en, 196@@ 3, Iwanami Shot@@ en, 196@@ 3, Iwanami Shot@@ en Publ@@ ish@@ ers, and other@@ s) that both Takauji and Takau@@ ji, who held the right to rule the position of the head of the government and the right to rule the power of the shogun since the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
The power of the two powers gradually led to the conflict between the anti-@@ Tadayoshi group and the Tadayoshi group of the anti-@@ Tadayoshi group of the anti-@@ Tadayoshi fact@@ ion.
This confl@@ icted with the internal strif@@ e called the Kanno Disturb@@ ance.
Takau@@ ji, at first had a neutr@@ al position, but was backed up by Moron@@ a@@ o's side.
In 134@@ 9, Tadayoshi besieged the residence of Moronao who had fled from the residence of Takau@@ ji, who had been attacked and raised an army in 134@@ 9.
Although Tadayoshi became a priest and retired from the government affairs, there is a theory that Moronao and Takauji were expelled from the Imperial Court by Moronao and Takau@@ ji, and there is a theory that they were actively intent@@ ionally intended by Taday@@ oshi.
Takauji summoned his legitimate son Yoshiakira to Kamakura to take charge of political affairs instead of Taday@@ oshi, and in addition, he made his second son Moto@@ uji ASHIKAGA, Kamakura kubo (@@ Governor-@@ general of the Kanto region) and set up Kamakur@@ a-@@ fu (@@ Kamakura Govern@@ or) to govern the eastern part of the Kanto region.
After Taday@@ oshi's retire@@ ment, Tada@@ fuyu ASHIKAGA, who was an illegitimate child of Takau@@ ji, extended his power to Tadayoshi in Kyushu, and in 135@@ 0, Takauji dispatched an expedition to the Chugoku region to sub@@ due Tada@@ fuyu to the Chugoku region.
Then, Tadayoshi escaped from Kyoto and joined the Southern Court and fought against the Southern Court, and some of the fudai daimyo such as Naot@@ sune MO@@ MO@@ I and Kuni@@ kiyo HATAKE@@ YAMA.
When Taday@@ oshi's power was weak@@ , Yoshiakira escaped from the capital and Takauji was defeated in Uchi@@ h@@ ama, Settsu Province (@@ Nishin@@ omiya City, Hyogo Prefecture) by Taday@@ oshi.
Takauji made peace with Tadayoshi on the condition that he would become a priest, and in 135@@ 1, peace was made between Tadayoshi and Taday@@ oshi.
Takan@@ ori UESUGI was murdered by Nor@@ in@@ ori UESUGI@@ .
Tadayoshi returned to government affairs as an assistant to Yoshi@@ akir@@ a.
Takauji and Yoshiakira went to Omi and Harima to fight against Doyo SASAKI and Nori@@ suke AKA@@ MATSU, and in fact, they attempted to hunt down and kill Tadayoshi and Tada@@ fuyu AKA@@ MATSU, and negot@@ iated with the Southern Court.
In respon@@ se, Tadayoshi escaped from the Hokuriku region and fled to Kamakura.
The reconcil@@ iation between Takauji and the Southern Court was completed in October of the same year, and this was called Sho@@ hei It@@ t@@ ei.
After the battle, Takauji followed Tadayoshi and advanced his army to the Tokai-do Road and fought in the battle of Sur@@ ug@@ a, Suruga Province (@@ Shim@@ izu Ward, Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture) and Sag@@ ami-@@ gawa River (@@ Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture) and captured Taday@@ oshi.
Tadayoshi suddenly died suddenly in February 135@@ 2.
"Taihei@@ ki" (The Record of the Great Peac@@ e) describes the suspicion of pois@@ oning by Takau@@ ji.
Soon after that, Takauji was defeated by the Southern Court such as Imperial Prince Mun@@ ey@@ oshi, Yoshioki NITTA and Tok@@ iyuki HOJO, but was defeated by the Southern Court forces of the Southern Court such as the Imperial Prince Mun@@ ey@@ oshi, and returned to Kyoto after defe@@ ating the Southern Court.
After that, Tada@@ fuyu ASHIKAGA invaded Kyoto but Tada@@ fuyu finally left for Kyushu.
In 135@@ 4, he was deprived of his position to the Southern Court and rec@@ ap@@ tured the following year.
Takauji himself planned to sub@@ due Tada@@ fuyu but died at the Nijo Nijo residence in Kyoto on April 30, 135@@ 8.
He died at the age of 5@@ 4.
According to "@@ Ume@@ -@@ ron@@ " (a book of views on the history of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and "@@ Ume@@ -@@ ron@@ " (a collection of the@@ ory) says that Takauji reg@@ ret@@ ted that he would be committed seppuku when he was killed in the battle, and it is assumed that Shin@@ ichi SA@@ TO, who had been killed in the battle, would have been a diseas@@ e.
Mus@@ o Soseki who had a close relationship with Takauji left a letter that he had a good relationship with him and left a letter that he appreciated the virtue of Takau@@ ji.
There is also a theory that Takauji was not able to reg@@ ain the reward for the military commander who was under the umbrell@@ a and was supported by the military commander in the difficult situation.
The opinion that Takauji was rebel@@ led against him was established by Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA in the Edo period.
The Mito school was strongly influenced by Shus@@ hig@@ aku (N@@ e@@ o-@@ Confucian@@ ism) and emphasized the legitim@@ acy of the Imperial line.
As a result, Takauji who had been expelled from the legitimate Emperor (Emperor Godai@@ go@@ ) was criticized as a rebel@@ .
After that, Takauji who came to Mit@@ og@@ aku continued to succeed to the throne, and in the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there was an incident in which the three generations of Takauji and Yoshiaki of the Toj@@ i@@ in Temple were exposed by the supporters of Sonno Joi (@@ 19th century sl@@ ogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreign@@ ers), Takauji and Yoshimitsu@@ .
In the Meiji period, the Meiji Government established a national historical view to establish a national state centered on the Emperor and the Emperor, but this was the historical view of the restoration of imperial rule and Restoration of Imperial Ru@@ le and Restoration of Imperial Ru@@ le and the Meiji Restoration was regarded as one of the most important reforms of the Taika Re@@ forms and the Meiji Restoration.
Until the middle of the Meiji period, the legitim@@ acy of Emperor Godaigo and the Southern Court were not so strong and the legitim@@ acy of the Northern and Southern Courts did not emphas@@ ize the legitim@@ acy of the legitim@@ acy of the Northern and Southern Cour@@ ts, but in the period of the Northern and Southern Cour@@ ts, the legitim@@ acy of Emperor Godaigo and the legitim@@ acy of the Southern Court was strongly insisted on the legitim@@ acy of the Northern and Southern Cour@@ ts, and as a result, the legitim@@ acy of the Southern Court and the Southern Court@@ 's legitim@@ acy of the Northern and Southern Court@@ 's legitim@@ acy of just@@ ification of the Northern and Southern Court@@ 's legitim@@ acy of just@@ ification of the Northern and Southern Court@@ 's legitim@@ acy of just@@ ification was defin@@ ed.
Before World War II, it was written as '@@ Sak@@ a@@ omi hik@@ im@@ i' in the text@@ book of national text@@ s, and the incident occurred in which the Minister of Commerce His@@ ayoshi NAKA@@ JIMA of the Saito clan wrote a letter to Takauji to write a letter of prai@@ sing Takau@@ ji.
After World War II, the national historical view of history was rapidly weak@@ ened and the study of posit@@ iv@@ ism was re@@ evaluated as a result of the advanc@@ ement of the study of historical history.
The evaluation of Takauji as the ruler of the lord system by Shin@@ ichi SATO was one example and this led to a significant impact on the study of the military government.
In the modern history, there is a view that Takauji was against a rebel@@ , and the progress of the study of historical research has become one of the theme of the study of history.
In the cultural asp@@ ect@@ , Ei@@ ji KIK@@ KAWA described Takauji as the main character in "@@ Shig@@ eki Taihei@@ ki" (The Record of the Great Peac@@ e), which was written by Takauji in the middle of the 195@@ 0@@ 's, but it is widely accepted that the evaluation of Takauji was greatly chang@@ ed.
The image of "@@ mounted warri@@ or@@ " possessed by the Kyoto National Museum is generally known as the portrait of Takauji and it is generally known that the name of "@@ mounted warri@@ or@@ " was placed on the upper part of the statue of the second Shogun Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA and that the name of "@@ horse@@ " was written on horse@@ back, and it is generally believed that the crest of KO no Moron@@ ori was not a family crest of the Ashikaga clan but a family crest of KO no Moron@@ ao, who was a steward of the Ashikaga clan but a child of KO no Mor@@ of@@ u@@ ji.
The statue of TAIRA no Shigemori of Jing@@ o-ji Temple, which is considered to have been painted by FUJIWARA no Takan@@ obu in the Kamakura period, is thought to have been the statue of TAIRA no Shigemori and TAIRA no Shigemori in the middle of the 199@@ 0s, but there is a theory that it was a statue of Takauji by Michi@@ o YO@@ SA@@ KURA, a histor@@ ian of art art history, and that the statue of Takauji was highly suppor@@ ted.
It is based on the fact that compared with the wooden statue owned by the Toj@@ i@@ in Temple, the kog@@ ai (@@ kog@@ ai, which is a kind of kog@@ ai which is a type of kog@@ ai, which is a type of kog@@ ai, which is a type of kog@@ ai, which is a type of kog@@ ai, which is a type of kog@@ ai that was popular in the early Muromachi period.
There is also a portrait of Takauji in Jod@@ o-ji Temple in On@@ om@@ ichi City, Hiroshima Prefecture.
In addition, there is a picture of a nishik@@ i-e (@@ colored woodblock print@@ ) painted by Tor@@ at@@ ora U@@ TA@@ GAWA in the Edo period, '@@ Taihei@@ ki' (@@ Record of the Great Peac@@ e) of "Taihei@@ ki" (The Record of the Great Peac@@ e), '@@ Takauji ASHIKAGA, who escaped to Fuku@@ kai@@ -ji Temple in Hyogo and Fuku@@ kai@@ -ji Temple@@ ' by Shu@@ en HASHI@@ MOTO, and '@@ Takauji ASHIKAGA@@ 's Battle of Hyogo Hyogo Kai@@ koku@@ ' (@@ picture of Takauji ASHIKAGA@@ ) by Shu@@ en HASHI@@ MOTO.
In addition, the bronze statue made in the modern age was built at B@@ ann@@ a-ji Temple in Ashikaga City and An@@ koku@@ -cho, Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture.
